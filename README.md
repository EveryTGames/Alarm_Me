# 🔔 Alarm Me

**Alarm Me** is a next-level alarm system for Android — not your typical clock app! Instead of setting alarm times, **you set smart rules** that trigger alarms based on notifications from your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Messenger, or Discord.

Whether it's a friend texting "wake up" or someone sending "#important#" — your phone will let you know in the most powerful way: with a full-on alarm! 😴➡️⏰

## 🧠 How It Works

You set **custom rules** per app:

- 📲 Choose the **App** (e.g., WhatsApp, Messenger, Discord)
- 🧑‍💬 Set **specific sender names** (or allow all)
- 📝 Define **trigger words or phrases**

If a notification matches your rule — BOOM! The alarm goes off.

### 📘 Example Use Case

Let’s say you want:

- From **WhatsApp**, only messages from “n1” or “n2” with the words “wake up” or “quiz” should wake you up.
- From **Messenger**, if **anyone** sends a message that contains `#important#`, you want an alert.
- From **Discord**, you want **any** message from **anyone** to trigger the alarm.

**Done.  "Alarm Me" handles it all — beautifully.** 🥹✨
