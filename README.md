# Alarm Me

**Alarm Me** is an intelligent, rule-based alarm app for Android that wakes you up or alerts you only when it truly matters.  
Unlike traditional alarms that rely on fixed times, Alarm Me listens to your notifications and activates based on the content, sender, and app â€” all customizable by you.

## How It Works

You create rules that define when an alarm should trigger, based on:

- **Apps**: Choose from any installed app like WhatsApp, Messenger, Discord, etc.
- **Senders**: Specify exact names, or allow all
- **Keywords**: Trigger on certain words or phrases
- **Mode**: Choose between AND (both must match) or OR (either matches)

When a notification matches your rule, the alarm activates immediately.

## Example Use Cases

- **WhatsApp**: Alarm rings only if "John" sends a message containing "quiz"
- **Messenger**: Any sender using `#urgent` in their message triggers an alarm
- **Discord**: All messages, regardless of sender, activate the alarm
